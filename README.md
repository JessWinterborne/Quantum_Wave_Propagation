# Wave_Animation
 
## Overview

This respositary contains work done for my 4th year masters project in mathmemtatics at the University of Bristol: Exploring Qauntum Wave Propagation and Scattering. First we developed a method for evolving and animating an intial wavefunction in time, in the notebook titled 'Wave_Animation'. We then developed code to plot the Wigenr functions of said wave functions in the notebooks 'Wigner_Plot', and combined the evolution and Wigner plot to create animations of them in 'Time_Evolving_Wigner' and 'Wigner_Animate'. 

In the 'Final_Results' notebook, we detail the different scenarios and variables used in order to create them, including basic wave-barrier interactions, as well as more complicated situations where we had more than one barrier. The implications of what we see are discussed in the 'Animation Analyses' section of my project, and we can see the animation in video format below. Finally, in 'R_and_T_From_Schrodinger', we use our wave animations to create plots of the reflection and transmissioncoefficients for varying energies in each scenario, using the integral of the modulus squared of final reflected and transmitted waves.
